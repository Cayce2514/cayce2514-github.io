# Bumpteroids

This workshop will show you how to use the P5.play libraries a bit more extensively to create a game similar to the classic game Asteroids.

It will look something like this:

Here's the [live demo](https://cayce2514.github.io/bumpteroids/) and [final code](https://github.com/Cayce2514/cayce2514.github.io/tree/master/bumpteroids).


This workshop should take around 60 minutes.

## Part I: Setup

## Set up Folder and files

1. Log in to your [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/) account and open your workspace.  If you haven't created your [Cloud 9](https://c9.io) account, go back to [Workshop 2](https://hackclub.com/workshops/personal_website/) and step through it.
2. Create a new folder called "bumpteroids".
3. Within the bumpteroids folder, create 3 new files.  `index.html`, `style.css` and the main file containing all of the game logic, `bumpteroids.js`.

## Part II: The HTML file
The HTML file is the main file that will be opened when someone goes to your game link.  This file ties together all of the libraries that are used, both external and internal as well as tying together your stylesheet and JavaScript file. 

## Part III: The CSS file
Here's some more text.

## Part IV: The JavaScript File
